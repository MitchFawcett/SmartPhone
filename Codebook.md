## Explanation of dsSummaryMRF.txt
Source data for the assignment was provided at this location:
 https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Source data files used by my solution:
     activity_labels.txt, features.txt, subject_test.txt, subject_train.txt, X_test.txt, 
     X_train.txt, y_test.txt, y_train.txt

 Source data files not used: Files in the Inertial Signals folders.  
 These were not seen to be critical to the dataset requested by the instructor. The dimensions
 of the set of files that I chose to use were consistent with one another and "made sense". 
 The inertial files seemed to be extraneous to the assignment. The FAQ appeared to confirm this.
